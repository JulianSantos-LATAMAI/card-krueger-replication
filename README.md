**Track A — Difference-in-Differences**

**Paper:** Card, D., & Krueger, A. B. (1994). Minimum Wages and Employment: 
A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
*American Economic Review*, 84(4), 772–793.

## Causal Question
The paper examines whether a minimum wage increase in New Jersey caused 
a reduction in fast-food employment. Using Pennsylvania as a control group, 
the authors apply a Difference-in-Differences design to compare employment 
changes before and after New Jersey's 1992 wage hike.
